# mpg123 git clone

(See README for actual information about mpg123 itself, this is about the Github mirror.)

This git repo tracks [mpg123's subversion repo](http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/scm/mpg123/).

## Branches

(This is going to change to benefit from CI actions.)

- [master](https://github.com/madebr/mpg123/tree/master): the actual mpg123 sources. This tracks mpg123 development.

- updater: contains scripts to keep the master branch up-to-date.
This is the default branch as cron github actions need to be defined in the default branch.
